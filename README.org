Easy online viewing and editing of Emacs org-mode TODOs, by Jakob Klemm.
* Introduction
For stuff like this.
* Setup
** Architecture
Owncloud + Emacs
** Variables
- =letter=, string.
  Letter used in =org-agenda= selection menu for the agenda, default is =a=. Special
  letters allow special filters to be applied within Emacs.
- =init=, string.
  Path to init file for Emacs config, default is =~/.emacs.d/init.el=
* Extraction
Get all TODO's with the following command, formatted as CSV.
#+begin_src sh
emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs.d/init.el -eval '(org-batch-agenda-csv "a" org-agenda-span (quote month))'
#+end_src
The following fields exist:
#+begin_src csv
category,head,type,todo,tags,date,time,extra,priority-l,priority-n
#+end_src
([[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Agenda-Information.html][Extracting Agenda Information]])
The shell script fetches that information and writes it to =current.csv=. From
there the data is parsed. =extract.sh= can simple be run by a CRON-Job.
